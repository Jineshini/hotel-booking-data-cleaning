# Data Cleaning Report: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

## Executive Summary

This report documents the data cleaning process performed on the **Hotel Booking Demand** dataset. The objective was to ensure data quality, remove inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling. Key actions included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and deriving meaningful features.

### Key Findings and Actions Taken:
- Missing values were found in several fields including `children` and `country`.
- Zero-guest entries and duplicate rows were identified.
- Cleaned dataset resulted in improved completeness and consistency.

## Data Quality Assessment

### Original Dataset Characteristics
- **Total records**: ~119,390 (as inferred)
- **Columns**: 32
- Mixed data types: numerical, categorical, date

### Identified Issues
| Issue                          | Affected Columns     | Severity |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Missing values                | `children`, `country`| High     |
| Zero guest entries            | Derived (`total_guests`) | Medium   |
| Duplicate rows                | Entire row           | High     |
| Inconsistent data types       | Not critical         | Low      |

## Cleaning Methodology

### 1. **Handling Missing Values**
- `children`: Filled with `0` assuming missing implies no children.
- `country`: Imputed using mode (most common value).
  
### 2. **Derived Features**
- `total_guests` was calculated as:  
  `adults + children + babies`

- Rows with `total_guests == 0` were flagged as invalid.

### 3. **Duplicate Removal**
- Identified and removed exact duplicate rows using `df.drop_duplicates()`.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Heatmap of missing values created to identify patterns.

## Results and Impact

### Before Cleaning
- Missing in `children`: ~4 entries
- Missing in `country`: Hundreds of entries
- Duplicate rows: Present (exact count not stated)
- Invalid guest records: Present

### After Cleaning
- All missing values in critical columns resolved.
- All duplicate and invalid guest entries removed.
- Dataset is now clean and ready for modeling.

## Recommendations

### Future Data Collection Improvements
- Ensure mandatory fields (`adults`, `children`, `babies`, `country`) are not nullable at the source.
- Enforce constraints to avoid zero-guest entries.
